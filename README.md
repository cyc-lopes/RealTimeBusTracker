# Real Time Bus Tracker

This project tracks the bus location in Boston, MA during each stop on the bus route between MIT and Harvard University. 

In order to run this program on your machine, you will need to click the green "CODE" button above the files, download the zip, extract all the files, and drag the HTML file onto your browser in a new tab. Once it's loaded, you can go ahead and click on the "Show bus stops between MIT and Harvard University" button.

Future improvements that would be helpful would be the ability to input two locations in separate text boxes, and have the map generate all bus stops that exist on the route between the two locations. The current version of this program is very basic, and does not provide much functionality to someone who does need to travel between MIT and Harvard University.
